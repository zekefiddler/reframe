# reFrame – the ePaper camera

<img src="docs/images/reframe-hero.jpg" alt="reFrame ePaper camera in hand" width="720" />

reFrame is an experimental digital camera designed to capture and display one photo at a time.

reFrame uses a 6-color ePaper display, giving each photo a distinctive dithered texture. After you press the shutter, the display takes about 20 seconds to refresh — colors cycle through as electrical charges physically move ink particles into place, like a digital polaroid.

The photo stays on screen even after powering off. The only way to clear it is to take a new one. When not in use, reFrame doubles as a desk photo frame.

## What's Inside

The open source version of reFrame uses only off-the-shelf components so anyone can build their own.

## Getting Started

**→ [Build Guide](docs/build-guide.md)** — How to assemble the camera hardware

**→ [Software Setup](docs/software-setup.md)** — How to install and configure the software on your Pi

**→ [Hardware Porting Notes](docs/hardware-porting.md)** — How to adapt the code for other e-ink displays, cameras, or buttons

**→ [Dashboard Extensions](docs/dashboard-extensions.md)** — Upload your photos directly from the camera to Are.na + more.

Once you have the hardware assembled and Raspberry Pi OS flashed, run:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y git
git clone https://github.com/kaloyaan/reframe.git
cd reframe
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

## Using the Camera

  <img src="docs/images/reframe.gif" alt="reFrame ePaper camera in action" width="720" />

reFrame is extremely minimalist by design. It has only a single button; no viewfinder, flash or zoom.

1. Press the combined power + shutter button to wake the camera and take a photo.
2. The original image is saved, then dithered to a 6-color palette to match the screen. The processed image is sent to the ePaper display.
3. The ePaper screen takes about 20 seconds to display the photo.
4. Press the button again to take a new photo. It'll replace the previous one on the display.
5. When you turn the camera off, the last photo will stay on the screen.

A web dashboard, accessible over the local network, lets you browse photos, download originals, change the displayed image, adjust camera settings, and optionally upload dithered photos to Are.na.
